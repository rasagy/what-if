What if you had to do all that I do, unnoticed, and all alone? Would you still have the same attitude?
What if you had it and let it slip away...???
What if you had a choice to find out who had interest in you, would you still want to know?
What if I had it. Would I be the best?
What if I had those answers you needed!
What if you had to answer all those questions?
What if I had a perfect life?
What if she had been paralyzed in a car accident?
What if she had no one to talk to or seek attention from? What would she do?
What if I had one more night for goodbye
